# Determining CVS from Lateral Cephalograms
## ABSTRACT

Traditionally, lateral cephalograms have been employed in the diagnostic and treatment planning of orthodontic patients. The degree of ossification in bone is referred to as skeletal maturation. Since the wide spectrum in the timing and duration of the pubertal growth spurt and other developmental phases, chronological age is inaccurate for assessing developmental state. Doctors and clinicians must examine lateral cephalograms to determine the orthodontic procedure to be provided to the patient. Doctors manually classify the cephalograms into six stages based on the shape of the bones. Each of the classes has distinct diagnostic procedures. This procedure is time intensive and has the disadvantage of being subject to random and systematic error, most errors occur in landmark identification, which is based on observer experience, landmark definition, and image density and sharpness and hence requires expertise. Therefore, automating this process would provide a more reliable platform. We plan on training a deep learning model to successfully classify the lateral cephalograms into one of the six CVS stages: Initiation (CVS 1), Acceleration (CVS 2), Transition, (CVS 3), Deceleration (CVS 4), Maturation (CVS 5), Completion (CVS 6).

## INTRODUCTION
In the field of dental and maxillofacial radiology (DMFR), reports on AI and deep learning
models used for diagnostic purposes and treatment planning cover a wide range of clinical
applications, including automated localization of craniofacial anatomical structures/pathological changes, classification of maxillofacial cysts and/or tumours, and
diagnosis of caries and periodontal lesions. Lateral cephalometry has been widely used for
skeletal classification in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. However, this
conventional system, requiring manual tracing of individual landmarks, contains possible
errors of inter and intra variability and is highly time-consuming.
Our project's goal is to create and evaluate an algorithm for determining cervical vertebral
stages in lateral cephalograms, which will represent an individual's growth and
development. Each cephalogram must be categorized into one of six phases. Each stage
requires a unique set of diagnostic procedures to be performed on patients. We are currently
acquiring lateral cephalograms collected by a Post Graduate student at the Dayananda
Sagar Dental College. At present, the number of images received are ~670. Around 570
images have been undergone different pre-processing techniques.
